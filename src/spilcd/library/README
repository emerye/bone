To build the code in this library, "cd build" and then type "cmake ..". Then type "make" 
in the build directory and the shared library libEBBLibrary.so should be
built. To deploy the library to your BeagleBone type "sudo make install" in the same 
directory. You should also place the library in the /exploringBB/library directory if you
are building the various examples in the chapters.

The parent directory /exploringBB/library currently contains a shared (.so) and statically
linked version (.a) of the library. See the examples on how to use this library. For 
example see exploringBB/chp09/LCDcharacter/build, which contains:

g++ LCDApp.cpp ../../library/libEBBLibrary.so -o LCDApp -I "../../library"

You can also use the static library by typing:

g++ LCDApp.cpp ../../library/libEBBLibrary.a -o LCDApp -I "../../library"

The steps involved are explained in detail at www.exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter9/

BUILDING DOCUMENTATION (perform this step on a desktop computer - not the BBB)

To build the documentation for this library, enter the docs directory and type:
  exploringBB/library/docs$ sudo apt-get install doxygen
  exploringBB/library/docs$ doxygen ExploringBB.Doxyfile 
The html documentation is built in the html directory and the LaTeX documentation can be built
latex directory if you have LaTeX installed (not recommended on the BBB itself).
